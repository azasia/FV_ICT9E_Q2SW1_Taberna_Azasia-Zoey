		<td class="corgi">Among the most agreeable of all small housedogs, the Corgi is a strong, athletic, 
		and lively little herder who is affectionate and companionable without being needy.  They are bright, sensitive dogs who enjoys play with his human family and responds well to training. </td>
		<td class="poms">The tiny Pomeranian, long a favorite of royals and commoners alike, has been called the ideal companion. The glorious coat, smiling, foxy face, and vivacious personality have helped make the Pom one of the world's most popular toy breeds. They will master tricks and games with ease, though their favorite activity is providing laughs and companionship to their special human.</td>
		<td class="cavapoo">The Cavapoo is a mixed breed dog â€” a cross between the Cavalier King Charles Spaniel and Poodle dog breeds. Outgoing, playful, and curious, these pups inherit some of the best traits from both of their parents.</td>
